## Description

shittyZip is a simplistic zip tool developed to provide an accessible way to practice golang development. It's a command-line utility to quickly and easily create zip archives from given files or directories.

> Note: As of now, this tool is meant for practice and learning purposes only, and it may not provide the best performance or compatibility with all zip functionalities and features.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Go environment, installation is as simple as executing the following command:
